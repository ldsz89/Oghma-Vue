## The Problem

Dungeons & Dragons is a fun and exciting game, but there are a lot of elements that are neccessary to create a new character. This application helps a user create a new character, and guides them through the process without the lengthy rulebook.

## The Solution

To solve this problem I've created a website that automates much of the procress of creating a character for a player. We've cut out the lore and tedious details that would turn away new players and presented just the information that's relevant to them. This was accomplished using a single controller, information gathered from a D&D 5e API, and local storage to save each character created.
